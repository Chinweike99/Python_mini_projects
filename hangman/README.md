**HANGMAN**
Hangman is a word-guessing game typically played between two people. One person thinks of a word and represents it using underscores,
with each underscore representing a letter in the word. The other person tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each
incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (representing a "hangman", (though there is no stick figure in my programme)) is drawn.
The goal is to guess the word before the entire stick figure is drawn, signifying the completion of the "hangman."

The Hangman game aids improvement on basic Python Knowledge such as:
 - Strings
 - Loops
 - Lists or Sets
 - Conditionals
 - Functions
 - Random module
